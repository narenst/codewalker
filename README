This is a Chrome Plugin to help two users look at same piece of code. One browser will become the 'master' and the other a 'slave'.

1. Once a session is setup, the slave loses the control of the browser tab.
2. Any url that the master goes to is sent to the slave and the page is opened there.
3. Also the top of the page is shared (so they both look at the same part of the page)
4. Any text highlighted is also sent across.

These are the starting goals of the hack. Time permitting, more can be done.
