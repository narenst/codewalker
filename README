CodeWalkr is a chrome plugin that will help in code walk-through over a browser. It is very simple to download and use. 

1. Download the plugin
2. Create a room and share the room id to participants.
3. One of the users selects 'master' mode.
4. From now on, any page the master visits will automatically be loaded in everyone else's browser.
5. When the master user clicks on any part of the page, everyone else is taken to that part of the page with the text highlighted.
